      HTML tags on text arrangement, style, color. Design a page which looks

    <h1>Assignment 1: Basic HTML Display Features</h1>
    <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
    <hr />
    <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
    <h3>header size</h3>
    <p>
      and <span class="textBlue">color</span> <span class="textRed">of</span>
      <span class="textGreen">letters</span> seen on the screen. The
      <span class="spanFontSize">font size</span> can be changed as well, and
      actually gives more choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some
      differing word types in a blocked quote.
    </p>
    <p class="secondPar">
      Now is the <em>time</em> for all good <strong>people</strong> to
      <strong>come</strong> to the <em>aid</em> of their country.
    </p>
    <p>That was also an example of a nested command.</p>
